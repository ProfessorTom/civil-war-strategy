# Civil War Strategy Game

## Introduction
W.R. Hutsell wrote a series of turn-based strategy games in the 1980's and 1990's, one of these was the VGA Civil War Strategy Game written over the years in several different iterations of Microsoft's BASIC implementations.

This repository provides the original source of the game as last released by Mr. Hutsell and over time will contain numerous additions and revisions to the existing code.

To grab a playable copy of the game, head to [https://hutsellgames.com/].

## Why?
I've been playing Hutsell's games since childhood. I still enjoy them. Mr. Hutsell generously provided me with the source code to his games and has agreed to release this code under the generous MIT license.

My goal is several fold:

1. To update CWS in such a way that it is enjoyable by contemporary gamers.
2. To provide myself with a low-stress project when I want to code for fun without a lot of the complications involved in much of modern development.
3. To practice various aspects of refactoring as the code evolves over time.
